Microsoft makes available this open source software (OSS) sample code (“Sample Code”) 
as a sample to help facilitate your creation of your own application to connect with a 
Twitter API in order to import your Twitter data into Advanced eDiscovery or other M365 service (“Application”). 
This Sample Code is intended to be a sample, and not a Microsoft product or service. It is licensed to you under the MIT license below. 

Your use of the Sample Code is subject to GitHub terms, and any access to Twitter and Twitter APIs with your Application is subject to Twitter terms. 
You are responsible for using the Sample Code in accordance with the GitHub terms. You are responsible for creating, configuring and using the your 
Application in accordance with Twitter terms and all other third party terms and applicable law. 
Microsoft is not party to any agreement between you and any third party (including Twitter and GitHub), 
with respect to your use of the Sample Code or your Application. Microsoft is also not responsible for, 
and disclaims all liability related to, your use of the Sample Code, your Application, and any Twitter APIs or other platforms.  

Please note that Microsoft is further not responsible for, and disclaims all liability related to, 
any data ingested with the Sample Code or your Application. You, as the data controller for your data, 
are responsible for all data ingested with your Application. Microsoft is also not responsible for, and disclaims all liability related to, 
any errors, data loss, or other losses that occur during or as a result of migrating any data into the M365 services. 
You will defend, hold harmless, and indemnify Microsoft from any claim or action brought by a third party, 
including all damages, liabilities, costs and expenses, and reasonable attorney fees, to the extent resulting from, 
alleged to have resulted from, or in connection with your export of data from Twitter and import of said data into the Application. 
To the extent you are a Microsoft customer, only after you have successfully migrated any data into the applicable M365 service 
will such data be considered “Customer Data,” for purposes of the [Online Service Terms](http://www.microsoftvolumelicensing.com/DocumentSearch.aspx?Mode=3&DocumentTypeId=46)
and [Privacy Statement](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=521839), and Microsoft’s data processing and other obligations. 
These terms of service do not constitute legal advice, and we recommend that you consult with legal counsel before downloading the Sample Code and enabling your Application.
